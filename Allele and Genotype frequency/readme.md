# Allele frequency and Genotype frequency 

The 'allele_freq.py' file iterated over all the basic allele report files generated by plink for each population group 
(the command can be found in the src directory) 
It uses the function generate in the src directory and calculates the alternate allele frequency based on this function.
Once the alternate allele frequency is obtained it gets the reference allele frequency.

The 'genotype_freq.py' file uses the file generated by 'allele_freq.py' and uses the Hardy-Weinberg equation to calculate the predicted
genotype frequencies.
