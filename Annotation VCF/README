# Annotation Folder README

## SnpEff

**Description:** SnpEff is utilized for annotating VCF files. The annotation primarily focuses on extracting gene names associated with SNPs, providing insights into potential genetic influences.

## Linking VCF SNP IDs to dbSNP IDs

**Description:** This section facilitates the linking of VCF SNP IDs to their corresponding dbSNP IDs, aiding in the comprehensive understanding and referencing of genomic variants.

## Clinical Implications Annotation

**Description:** Within this folder, various methodologies are employed to establish links between SNPs and potential clinical implications or traits. Information from GWAS websites and ClinVar is utilized to explore and identify clinical associations, enhancing the comprehension of genetic influences on health outcomes.
