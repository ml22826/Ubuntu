snpEF --> used to annotate the vcf, what was especially useful from the annotation was the gene names where the SNP could be acting upon 

Linking VCF SNP IDs to their dbSNP IDs --> 

Clinical implications annotation --> Folder shows multiple methods used to link each SNP to potential clinical impacts or traits. To find clinical implications we used information from gwas website and from clinvar
